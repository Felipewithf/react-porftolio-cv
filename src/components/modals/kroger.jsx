The Kroger Leadership Summit is a biennial event that includes managers from every store, manufacturing facility, distribution center and office in the country along with thousands of local employees, families, friends and other partners, which brings the grand total of attendees up to about 7,000 people. Those assembled for the event discussed the company's growth strategy and Kroger's ongoing commitment to its customers, associates and the communities it serves.
