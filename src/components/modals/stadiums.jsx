        Creative proposal selected by FIFA and the Modex team for an exciting sci-fi
        narrative project that depicts a plausible evolution of football beyond Earth!
        Alongside FIFA & Modex team, we created 14 football arenas beyond Earthâ€”matches
        held on Mars, Venus, Asteroids, imaginary planets, etc. These sci-fi stadiums are
        now part of FIFA's digital collectible division and the first artist-driven
        digital collectible by them. What's more, collecting 12 stadiums will give you a
        chance to win Right-To-Buys for the upcoming FIFA World Cup 2026, provided
        directly from FIFA. To view the final collectibles and more information about the
        project visit:{" "}
